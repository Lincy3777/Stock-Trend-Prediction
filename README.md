# Stock-Trend-Prediction
 This Stock Trend Prediction application utilizes historical stock data and advanced machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices. At its core, the application employs an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly effective for time series data, such as stock prices.<br> The application fetches real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance and provides users with insightful predictions based on recent trends. By focusing on crucial indicators key data point, the LSTM model learns complex patterns and trends within the closing price data over time. This capability allows it to capture the temporal dependencies that are often present in financial markets, enabling it to make informed predictions about future price movements.<br> Users can input any stock ticker symbol to view the latest closing prices and a graphical representation of historical performance. The application also displays the predicted closing price for the next time interval, enabling users to make informed decisions about buying, holding, or selling stocks.  With an intuitive and user-friendly interface built using Streamlit, this tool not only enhances users' understanding of stock market dynamics but also serves as a practical resource for improving investment strategies. By leveraging the power of LSTM neural networks
